# WEB DESIGN LAMP Ubuntu 12.04 (Linux Apache + Mysqp + PHP)
#
# What I needed to do to get my LAMP working, all automated.
#
# This was originally taken from:
# http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/486
# but I have skipped steps that I didn't need to do, and
# automated all the file editing.
# 
# If ever one part of the process does not return sucessful,
# stop immediately.

# apache
sudo apt-get install apache2 && \

# php
sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 && \
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart && \
# create a file to test php:
echo '<?php phpinfo(); ?>' | sudo tee /var/www/testphp.php > /dev/null && \ 

# mysql
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
# he will ask you for the password, fill it in
# mysql -u root # the tutorial said do that, but I didn't need to. This would be for the password.

# phpmyadmin
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql phpmyadmin && \
# gksudo gedit /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini # according to tutorial, should uncomment ;extension=mysql.so, but I could not find it in the file. still works.

# make sure 'Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf' is in the apache config file
apacheconf='/etc/apache2/apache2.conf'
ensureline='Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf'
grep $ensureline apacheconf && ( echo $ensureline | sudo tee -a $apacheconf > /dev/null ) && \

# TEST TIME:
firefox http://localhost/ # to test apache
firefox http://localhost/testphp.php # to test php
firefox http://localhost/phpmyadmin # login: 'root'. password: what you entered at installation.
