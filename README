# Dependencies

Before you use this collection, run

    install-depencies-apt-get

if you have apt-get on your distro so that you have all the necessary dependencies.

# Intro

This is my collection of simple bash scripts and related languages ( only awk for the moment ).

I use this to

- learn bash
- automate simple repetitive tasks

For more complex tasks, I tend to use python scripts instead.

# File naming convention

## Extensions

- no extension : runnable scripts
- .bashsrc : sourceable files (to be used in scripts with '.' (dot) operator instead of run directly )
- .cheatsheet : a cheatsheet ( collection of related commands with simple examples and explanaitions, whole script not to be run directly)
- .BUG : scripts that contain a known bug. the bug should be indicated in the header.
- .NOTEST : scripts that have not been tested

## Word separation

'-' (hyphen) as seem to be the most standard for bash scripts

# Abbreviations

- ext : extension
- opt-ext : optional extension
