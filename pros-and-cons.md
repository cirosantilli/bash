# Pros and Cons

## Pros

Bash golfs extremely well for:

- process management (pipes, stdout, jobs)
- file IO (`echo a > b`)
- history
- tab completion, partially circumvented on other languages by editor autocompletion

## Cons

Bash is evil:

- has evil quoting
- has arithmetics, boolean arithmetics, etc.
- evil to get values out of functions
- does not cross operating systems
- lacks good libraries
- slow
