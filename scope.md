# Scope

POSIX mandates things like:

-   POSIX language features, which account for a large part of its language features.

    All language features are documented in this project.

-   utilities, either build-in or not, e.g. `ls`, `mkdir`, etc.

    As a rule of thumb, utilities which seem touch bash internals, and are more easily implemented as built-ins will be documented here, e.g. `cd`, `pwd`.

    Other utilities which feel more external will documented at the [Linux Cheat](https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-cheat)
