#!/usr/bin/env bash

#1 intro

# this is probably the most powerful commands in bash.

# there are basically 3 parts to a find:
# find <where> <what> <do-what-with-finds>

find . -name '*' -print
# finds all files under current dir.

find .
# same as above. Default criteria is match anything (*) and default action is to print

#1 search criteria

#2 name and iname.

# match ENTIRE basenames posix expression

find . -name 'README'
# finds files named EXACTLY README. does not match README.txt

find . -name '*.txt'
# finds ENRTIRE basenames that match 'posix-exp' case sensitive. will NOT match ./asdf.txt.pdf

find . -iname '*.mp?'
# same as -name but case insensitive

#2 path. looks at whole file path posix expression

find . - path './*'
# finds anything under current dir. Note how relative paths all start with a dot slash './'

find . -path '*/.*'
# finds only paths are either hidden or have a hidden parent. alson consider prune for this.

find . -path './.vim/*'
# finds anything under ./.vim folder. same as find ./vim

#2 regex. looks at whole paths with posix regex

find . -regex '^/home/.*\.txt$'
# finds paths under /home, that end in .txt

#2 posix regex
# a posix expreis not a regexp: it has much less functions, including:
# * := .* of a regexp
# ? := . in a regexp

#2 type

find . -type f
# files only

find . -type d
# directories only

#2 maxdepth

find . -maxdepth 1
# find in current dir only

find . -maxdepth 2
# find in current and direct sons only

#2 prune

# do not search into directories that match what comes before prune.

# this is more efficient than using path to cut out directories.

# do not the -o 'or' operator after each prune.

find . -path '*/.*' -prune -o -type f -iname '*.txt'
# finds files that end in '.txt'
# does not go into directories whose -path '*/.*' is true (hidden dirs)
# INCLUDES hidden directories and hidden files themselfves which are not inside hidden directories!!! check next example for the correct method to avoid hiden files

find . '*/.*' -prune -o ! -name '.*'
# finds all files that are neither hidden themselves, nor are a child of a hidden parent. =)

find . '*/.*' -prune -o ! -name '.*'
# prunes with multiple criteria 

#2 -samefile

find . -samefile file1
# find all content (HASH) duplicates of file1

find . -xdev file1
# do not go into other devices ( for instance, inode operations! )

# you can concatenate multiple criteria logically.

#2 not !
find . -iname '*.pdf'
# find paths which are pdf and which are files. the and is implicit

#2 and -a implicit when no criteria is specified
find . -type f -iname '*.pdf'
# find paths which are pdf and which are files. the and is implicit

find . -type f -a -iname '*.pdf'
# same as above. the and is explicit here

#2 or -o

find . -iname '*.pdf' -o -iname '*.djvu'
# paths either terminated by pdf or djvu extension

find . -type f -iname '*.pdf' -o -iname '*.djvu'
# files only, either pdf of djvu extension. Therfore or has higher precedence over and.

#2 parenthesis

# you can change logical operation precedence with parenthesis.

# do not forget to escape your parenthesis!

find . \( -type f -iname '*.pdf' \) -o -iname '*.djvu'
# either files with extension pdf of paths (includes dirs) with extension djvu. Parenthesis are used to change precendence order.

#1 actions

# you can do things with the files you find. There are two main ways to do that: -exec and -print0 | xargs.

# xargs tends to be more flexible

find . -iname '*.tex' -exec pdflatex '{}' +
# compile all tex under current dir.
# {} gets expanded to the found path by -exec, and the commands ends when a trailling '+' is found

find . -iname '*.tex' -print0 | xargs -0 -I '{}' pdflatex '{}'
# does the same as above.
# -print0 prints files null (\0) terminated. this avoids problems since filenames that can contain newlines, but not null chars.
# -0 tells xargs that the input is null separated
# -I '{}' tells xargs that {} should be substituted by each arg one at a time

find . -iname '*.tex' -print0 | xargs -0 -I '{}' sh -c "bibtex '{}'; pdflatex '{}'"
# execute multiple commands for each argument of xargs. must use sh -c, it is the only way without an explicit loop.
# use this only for very simple multiple commands, or you are going to go crazy with quoting. for larger commands use an explicit loop as in next example.

# NOTE: i don't know why exaclty, but the following fails:
# find . | xargs echo `basename {}`
# this is probably because `basename {}` gets evaluated before {} is replaced by the find result
# basename {} returns {}, and AFTER THAT {} gets expanded to the find result ( not just the basename therefore )
# if you want to do stuff like that, a better solution is the 

find . -print0 | while read -d '' FILE; do echo "$FILE"; echo asdf; done
# THIS is THE more flexible stable way of doing lots of operations in bash I could find

#1 useful calls that use the basic things above

#2 good bye Windows... 

find . -name 'Thumbs.db' -delete 
# remove all Thumbs.db

find . -name 'AlbumArt*Large.jpg' -exec mv -n '{}' Front.jpg +
find . -name 'AlbumArt*' -delete
# remove AlbumArt from music.
# first make a copy of the cover with name 'Front' if you don't have one yet
# notice the irony, not only you kill Windows, but you first use their good (but somewhat ugly named and spreading two many files) service of downloading covers for you!
