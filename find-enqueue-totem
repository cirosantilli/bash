# finds music under current dir and enqueues it in totem

# arguments are the same as for find-music.
#
# no point in using this with Krusader user actions of course... =)
#
# sample use:
#
#	find . -name '*rec=igor*' -print0 | xargs -0 find-enqueue-totem
# 	# opens music under folders with name rec=igor

#
# TODO:
#
#   I would have liked to make a m3u with relative paths,
#   beacause otherwise totem enqueues with an ugly full path before seeing the actual name (id3 name I guess)
#   I couldn't do this because it would either creating and removing a temp file in current dir, which is a problem
#   since if I remove it immediatelly totem won't have the time to see it, or if totem had an option to choose current
#   dir even if m3u is outside...

#   passing them one by one is not an option in general because of limits to the amount of data that can be passed in a shell
# 
#------------------------------------------------------------

# must make a temporary file on the fly, or there could be two many arguments for xargs.
